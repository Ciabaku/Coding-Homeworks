                        These were the early days; you
                        could fit everything there was
                        to know about HTML into
                        the back of your car. Pages
                        weren’t pretty, but at least
                        they were hypertext enabled.
                        No one cared much about
                        presentation, and just about
                        everyone on the Web had
                        their very own “home page.”
                        Even a count of the number
                        of pencils, paperclips, and
                        Post-it notes on your desk
                        was considered “web content”
                        back then (you think we’re
                        kidding).

                        The long, cold days of the
                        “Browser Wars.” Netscape
                        and Microsoft were duking it
                        out for control of the world.
                        After all, he who controls the
                        browser controls the universe,
                        right?
                        At the center of the fallout
                        was the web developer.
                        During the wars, an arms
                        race emerged as each browser
                        company kept adding their
                        own proprietary extensions
                        in order to stay ahead. Who
                        could keep up? And not
                        only that, back in those days,
                        you had to often write two
                        separate web pages: one for
                        the Netscape browser and
                        one for Internet Explorer. Not
                        good.

                        Ahhh…the end of the Browser
                        Wars and, to our rescue, the
                        World Wide Web Consortium
                        (nickname: W3C). Their plan:
                        to bring order to the universe
                        by creating the ONE HTML
                        “standard” to rule them all.
                        The key to their plan?
                        Separate HTML’s structure
                        and presentation into two
                        languages—a language for
                        structure (HTML) and a
                        language for presentation
                        (CSS)—and convince the
                        browser makers it was in their
                        best interest to adopt these
                        standards.
                        But did their plan work?
                        Uh, almost…with a few
                        changes (see HTML 4.01).

                        The good life:
                        HTML 4.01
                        entered the
                        scene in
                        1999, and
                        was the
                        “must have”
                        version of
                        HTML for the
                        next decade.
                        4.01 wasn’t
                        really a big
                        change from
                        4.0; just a few
                        fixes were
                        needed here
                        and there.
                        But compared
                        to the early
                        days of HTML
                        (when we all
                        had to walk
                        barefoot in
                        six feet of
                        snow, uphill
                        both ways),
                        HTML 4.01
                        allowed us all
                        to sleep well
                        at night
                        knowing that
                        almost all
                        browsers (at
                        least the ones
                        anyone would
                        care about)
                        were going to
                        display our
                        content just
                        fine.

                        Just as we were all getting comfortable, a shiny object distracted everyone. That shiny object was XML. In fact, it really distracted HTML, and the two got hitched in a shotgun marriage that resulted in XHTML 1.0. XHTML promised to end all the woes of the Web with its adherence to strictness and new way of doing things. The only problem was, people ended up hating XHTML. They didn’t want a new way to write web pages, they just wanted to improve what they already had with HTML 4.01. Web developers were far more interested in HTML’s flexibility than XHTML’s strictness

                        Of course, with no support from the community, the marriage didn’t end well and was replaced by new version of HTML named HTML5. With its support for most of the HTML 4.01 standard, and new features that reflect the way the Web has grown, HTML5 is what developers were looking for. And, with features like support for blog-like elements, new video and graphic capabilities, and a whole new set of capabilties aimed at building web applications, HTML5 was destined to become the standard.
